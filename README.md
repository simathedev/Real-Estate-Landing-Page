# Real Estate Landing Page

This is one of the earliest projects I've createad while learning React.
This project is a single-page application (SPA) designed to showcase properties from a real estate agency. It incorporates modern web development technologies and follows best practices for user interface (UI) design. As a Developer, I aimed to develop practical skills while crafting a visually appealing and interactive website.
